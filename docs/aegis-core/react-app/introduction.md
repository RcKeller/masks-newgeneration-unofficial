### Introduction

Foundry normally renders UI through Handlebars templates.
This module lets you build those same interfaces using **React**.

A React app in Foundry is just a normal React component tree, mounted inside a Foundry window. You can use state, effects, and any React libraries you like.

This approach is useful when building:

-   Rich user interfaces with interactive state
-   Documentation browsers, character sheets, or dashboards
-   Any window that benefits from React’s component model
