### Introduction

Foundry normally renders chat messages as static HTML templates.
This system lets you render **React components directly inside chat cards**.

By using React, you can build interactive and dynamic chat entries, such as:

-   Rich roll results with custom UI
-   Buttons, toggles, or prompts inside chat
-   Components that respond to game state
