# Aeris Core

![Example](modules/aeris-core/images/aeris-core-docs-01.png)

Aeris Core is a toolkit for building modern interfaces and in-game documentation for Foundry VTT. It provides:

-   A **React application wrapper**, letting you mount a React component tree inside a Foundry window. You can style freely with Tailwind or any other CSS approach.
-   A **Markdown documentation system**, so you can ship clear, searchable reference material directly in-game without extra setup.

These docs include examples of how to set up a React app, create React based chat messages, and add documentation pages.

If you’d like to help fund future improvements, you can buy me a coffee - thank you for any support!
