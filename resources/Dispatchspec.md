YOUR TASK - ORGANIZE ALL MY THOUGHTS AND COME UP WITH A SPECIFIC AND ACTIONABLE PROMPT THAT I CAN USE TO ASK AN AI TO GENERATE 100 CREATIVE CALL SCENARIOS FOR MY CHRISTMAS SPECIAL TTRPG GAME.
===============
I have adapted the mechanics for the TTRPG based on Powered by the Apocalypse called Masks: A New Generation. This repository has all the code and resources used to run this game.

I have implemented a "Dispatch" mechanic in the game which is where we present a series of Calls from citizens and organizations requesting the aid of a superhero. We have roughly mapped out some of the mechanics from the gameplay of dispatch to how we handle these in our game system:

Here's a brief table of the mechanics in dispatch, the rough equivalent in masks, and how I've reconcilled them and implemented them in our system:

Injuries in Dispatch are Conditions in Masks. Gameplay leads to players taking Conditions which are small injuries that can eventually KO them.
In Dispatch, Call success is determined by luck based on hero stats. In Masks, Calls have stat requirements, which if met or failed can give players a modifier to their next roll, which will be how they decide to resolve the call.
Players responding to a call are first assessed on their fit. This can give them a small bonus or penalty towards how they resolve the call, which could be something like Directly Engage a Thread, Unleash your Powers, etc.
Unlike Dispatch, Calls have compound requirements - they could require thresholds for every single label. Meet 2 or more for a partial success (no effect), and meet all of them to receive a bonus ("Forward") on your roll.
In Dispatch, you level up. In Masks, external forces such as the influence of adults will "Shift" your labels one way or the other - but you don't necessarily get better. You can, however, earn potential to be able to learn new abilities.

Stats are roughly mapped:

Combat: Danger
Vigor: Freak
Movement: Savior
Charisma: Mundane
Intellect: Superior


We are planning on having a session soon.


WHAT I NEED YOU TO DO is come up with the prompt for me to order the creation and preparation of MANY calls with the following:

- Stat thresholds (-3 to 4) for each label:
    Danger
    Freak
    Savior
    Mundane
    Superior
- Caller name
- Paragraph from the call transcript to read to the players (1-4 sentences max) (HTML, but is mostly the content of a <p> element)
- Unordered list of 2-4 bullet pointed requirements (HTML), very short sentences with keywords and phrases bolded in <b>.

If a stat is not relevant, leave blank.
It needs to be FAIR, with the understanding that the median stat for a player will be 0 or -1.

THEMES FOR THIS UPCOMING SESSION:
- Everyday challenges Teen superheroes would rise to the occasion to face
- Christmas is coming up - need to help santa and others deliver presents
- Crooks and villains attempting to ruin christmas
- A pack of criminal bears have been pulling off crimes across town. They must be stopped. A lot of the crimes and calls should be loosely related to their not-so-organized bear themed criminal empire. The list of bear villains is provided below

Crew nods. Nobody asks where he’s getting the semi. He always gets the semi.

Present – 11:11 PM:
Slick slides into a parked rig like he left something in it yesterday. Fires it up. Polos don't blink. Drones don’t care. He rolls forward casual, pulls up tight behind the merch truck, just left of Vault Trailer #09.

Cameras lose line of sight. VIP rope’s out of view. He kills the engine. Steps out.

Adjusts the trilby.
Taps the rig twice like it's a trusted steed.
Then: "Loading dock’s open, baby. Let’s move."

Your move.```

Overview
As the player works a shift, they will receive various calls from SDN subscribers seeking assistance, for both small situations, like getting a balloon out of a tree, to large escalations, like rescuing people from a fire. It is the dispatcher's job will be to try and assign the best suited hero available and to make sure all calls are handled (and ideally done successfully).

Answering calls
A call coming in.
A call coming in.
1/3
When a call comes in, there will be a limited amount of time to pull it up and assign a hero. Clicking on the call will cause time will pause to allow the player to read over the briefing and see what kind of assistance they need. Keywords will stand out that indicate the optimal stat(s) needed as well as any other possible factors.

It is important to note it is not immediately necessary to assign a hero right away: the player can exit out from it to view others on the map or let time continue. A small auditory countdown rings before the call auto-fails.

Competing calls
Unlike regular calls, a set of special calls that directly conflict with each other will appear together, as indicated by a pink icon with a hand showing two talk bubbles: an X and a check mark. Like other calls, there is a countdown on which one to pick, but unlike regular calls, the player can only pick one option, with the other going away once a decision is dispatched. In these situations, the reward for each choice will be shown in the briefing (such as XP for a particular hero if they're sent vs. some XP split across the entire Z-Team).

Hack calls
Occasionally, the player receives a call where no heroes are dispatched, but Robert must hack in order to resolve the call.

Assigning heroes
When a call comes in, the player will need to select a hero from the available roster and dispatch them. Certain calls may allow assigning more than one hero, though it is possible to still send fewer than allowed, particularly if their powers add some benefit to this setup (such as Invisigal's allowing her to work faster alone).

When a hero is assigned, their status will change to "busy" as they make their way there and complete the task. Afterwards, they'll change to "returning" as they head back to SDN's HQ. Once back, they'll enter a small "resting" period where they can't be assigned out until they've recovered. A draining green meter above a hero's profile indicates how much time is left before they are ready again. The player needs to review the results of the call before the hero dispatched on that can be assigned out again as well (even if they've recovered).

Calls will come in throughout the shift, often overlapping with others. As heroes need time to rest after they return to SDN's HQ, this means the optimal hero may not be available in time if already out on a call, returning, or resting. This creates a balancing between accepting calls near expiration to wait for the appropriate hero to be available or compromising and using other heroes that may still get the job done.

There are certain calls where a hero may ask to be assigned specifically and will remember if allowed to be dispatched or not, given that they are available at the time of accepting the call. Other times, a hero will automatically take a call for themselves to handle, unable to be removed.

Stats
To read more about stats, see the Stats page.
Each hero and call will rely on stats to help determine the outcome. These stats are: Combat, Intellect, Vigor, Charisma, and Mobility. It is usually impossible know the full extent of the stats needed for a situation, but the information highlights keywords to determine the best suited hero for the job. For example, convincing a group of people typically requires for high intellect and charisma over mobility and vigor.

When a call allows more for than one hero to be dispatched, the stats of all of the dispatched heroes will be summed for bigger stats and increased chances of success.


Advertisement
Intervening
In certain situations, the player will be alerted to an assigned call that needs the dispatcher's attention, as indicated by a red hand stop sign. This also has a countdown.

For these, the hero needs the player to pick an option on how to proceed in the situation. Picking on an option will focus on a single stat rather than the sum of all stats to determine the chance a mission succeeds.

There are also certain calls that allow a certain hero to resolve it themselves if that hero was chosen to be dispatched on that call.

Scoring
After a hero finishes a call, the player will need to review it before the heroes that were dispatched on that call can be assigned again after resting. Depending on the type of call and situation, there are several different ways in how an outcome is decided.

For basic situations where the stat chart is shown in full when reviewing, the call's chart appears in white before the assigned hero's/heroes' overall stats overlaps it in orange. If the call's chart fits perfectly within the hero's chart, it'll give a 100% and be successful. Otherwise, the score is calculated by how much overlap there is and then a moving marker that bounces around the call's white outlined area. If it lands on an overlapping area with the hero's, it'll be successful. Otherwise, if it lands in an area where the hero's chart doesn't overlap it, it'll fail. This can lead to some risky chances as a hero in one playthrough may succeed while in another, fail.

For situations where intervention was required, these will instead rely on one particular stat related to the scenario. When picking an option on how to proceed, the call will show the state needed to be successful before the hero's stat appears. If the hero's/heroes' chosen state matches or exceeds the call's number, it will be successful.

In intervening situations where hero-specific choices are available, this will result in a fixed result, usually successful, without the need to check the hero's stat. However, conversely, some missions that allow a certain hero to resolve it may result in an automatic failure, such as sending Flambae to take out a fire or sending Waterboy to stop a flooding, both who can create the element they are associated with but not absorb it.

No matter how it's scored, if successful, the hero(es) that were assigned see an immediate XP reward, indicated by a number that appears for a brief time over the star icon on their profile picture. Heroes also receive XP from calls they were dispatched on, but have an interference where the option chosen was to hack.

Reviewing
At the end of each shift, the game would review the player's performance by tallying successful, failed, and missed calls during the shift.

Having heroes succeed in more missions will increase Robert's rank as a dispatcher; higher ranks come with benefits, such as access to a bandage to heal an injured hero and a defibrillator to recover a downed hero.

Trivia
If Malevola is sent to hero training, one of the possible abilities the player can choose for her to gain is the ability to show the stats needs to pass a mission after having healed another hero previously.

Dispatch stats chart
Stats are the main mechanic that decides the outcome of a call in Dispatch.

1	Overview
2	Upgrading
3	Dispatching outcomes
4	Injuries
Play VideoBrand logo




Overview
There are 5 stats in the game:

Dispatch icon combat Combat
Dispatch icon intellect Intellect
Dispatch icon vigor Vigor
Dispatch icon charisma Charisma
Dispatch icon mobility Mobility
Each of these stats affect how a hero is likely (or unlikely) to succeed in an assigned call. As a hero levels up, Skill Points are earned to help increase these stats.

Upgrading
After a hero levels up, you can then go into the hero database (the folder icon on the right of the map) and view the "Upgrade" tab (top left) to select what to increase. Note that once you confirm a change, this cannot be reverted.

All heroes reach level 2 at 1000 gained XP, and every subsequent level has an added 300 XP to reach. The only exceptions being Invisigal, who reaches level 2 at 700 and Waterboy who reaches level 2 at 400.

Dispatching outcomes
Each hero and call will rely on stats to help determine the outcome. You won't know the full extent of the stats needed for a situation, so you need to carefully assess the information/keywords it provides to determine the best suited hero for the job.

With certain calls where you can send more than one hero, the stats will be combined to get bigger stat numbers and potentially a better outcome.

Injuries
Sometimes, if a hero fails at a call, they can be injured. If this happens, all their stats will decrease by 1. Injuries can also stack such that if they're still injured and they get injured again, they'll become downed.

Synergy

Sign in to edit
This article is about the gameplay mechanic. For the episode, see Synergy (episode).
Synergy is a gameplay factor that allows for a major increase in success chance when certain heroes are sent together in Dispatch. It is available beginning the second dispatch in episode 3.

Gameplay
After Robert berates the Z-Team for sabotaging each other to avoid being cut for underperforming, the player can pair up certain characters up during the second shift that day to increase the chances a mission succeeds. These pair also not sabotage each other when sent together during the first shift.

After activating synergy for the first time, synergistic pairs will increase the chances of a mission passing by 5%, up to 15% at max level (3); synergy levels can be increased by sending synergy pairs out together as much as possible.

This can be used when their combined stats alone do not suffice to cover all the required stats to pass the mission without fail. For example, if a synergy pair whose synergy level stands at level 2 is dispatched on a mission, and the pair's stats only cover 90% of the required stats, their synergy level will increase the chance of success by 10%, effectively making the chance 100% and skipping the success check.

Synergy Pairs
Currently, there are eight combinations of characters that will result in synergy. The first initial four are:

Golem and Invisigal
Prism and Flambae
Malevola and Sonar
Punch Up and Coupé
The fifth replacement pair is dependent on the member the player cuts in Episode 3 and the member the player adds to the Z-Team in Episode 4. See "effects below" for more info.

Malevola and Phenomaman
Malevola and Waterboy
Punch Up and Phenomaman
Punch Up and Waterboy
Phenomaman and Blonde Blazer were originally a synergistic pair during the final dispatch, but this has been patched out.

Effects
At the end of Episode 3, the player must choose to let go of either Coupé or Sonar. Whoever is chosen, their closest comrade (Punch Up or Malevola respectively) will act out in the following episode by pulling a prank, refusing to take certain calls, making snide remarks, before eventually leaving early for the first shift.

Before the second shift, Blonde Blazer presents Robert two choices to pick from to add to the team: Phenomaman or Waterboy. Whoever the player picks will then fill in as the new synergistic partner for whichever team member (Punch Up or Malevola) lost theirs.

Lost Balloon
This is the very first call, so stats for heroes will all be the same starting off. In this case, sending Flambae will net a perfect 100% score, though a few others can be sent and still be successful. Coupé will not be though and will likewise foreshadow this if she's sent (telling Robert this isn't aligned with her skills).

EPISODE 7

Episode 7 Choice Effects
During Retrospective, the Z-Team takes a vote on kicking Invisigal off the team and only Golem votes for her to stay. Robert is then given the choice to either cut or keep Invisigal on the team.

Invisigal's presense
If cut from the team, she will be absent for all phases of the shift.
If kept on the team, she will arrive late after Malevola during the first phase.
Low Morale Debuff
If Robert decides to keep Invisigal on the team, a pop-up will notify that the Z-Team's morale has dropped. Following this decision, a debuff will be applied to all of your heroes' stats, decreasing by 1 in each stat category. These stats can be brought down to a minimum of 1.
Note: Flambae will not vote to cut Invisigal if Robert revealed that he's Mecha Man, but the debuff will still apply to him. Phenomaman abstained from voting, but the debuff will still apply to him (only if you added him to the team in Restructure).

This debuff will not affect the following heroes:
Golem
Invisigal
Whoever you didn't pick between Phenomaman/Waterboy to replace Sonar/Coupé
Blonde Blazer

HONEY HEIST GAME LOG (the villains came from this game)
================
Welcome to HONEY HEIST
Two things:
You have a complex plan that requires precise timing.
You are a GODDAMN BEAR.
Mechanics
You have two stats, both start at 3: BEAR and CRIMINAL.
Roll 1d6 when the outcome is in doubt. If the roll is ≤ the relevant stat, you succeed; otherwise you fail.
If you’re using your Bear special skill or your Role, roll 2d6 and keep the lowest.
 
Image
Image
Rules
Never edit posts that include actions (post a correction if needed).
Start every mechanical action with $$ and keep it brief/specific.
Example: $$ Slip under the velvet rope and lift a VIP badge (CRIMINAL, Thief).
Rolls: Use your server’s roller (e.g., /roll 1d6) right after your action. If using a role/special skill, roll /roll 2d6 and keep the lowest (state which die you’re keeping).
Flashbacks: Start with $$ FLASHBACK: and do a 2–5 sentence montage; adjust stats as above.
The GM will end each update with an Action Queue (who we’re waiting on).
If you’re at the top of the queue, please post within 24 hours or pre‑load your actions via DM.
You may DM the GM pre‑loads/conditionals (e.g., “If I’m spotted, I immediately climb the trailer (BEAR, Black).”).
Changing States
Actions
Flashback: You may move 1 from BEAR to CRIMINAL by playing a quick flashback scene of planning in a smoky back room.
Eat Honey: You may move 1 from CRIMINAL to BEAR by eating a load of honey.
Reactions
Frustration: When the plan hits a snag or you fail meaningfully, move 1 point from CRIMINAL to BEAR.
Greed: When things go off without a hitch or you pull a slick success, move 1 point from BEAR to CRIMINAL.
Goals
If CRIMINAL = 6 > you’re lured into a life of crime and betray the crew.
If BEAR = 6 > you flip out bear‑style and lose control until animal control arrives.
Character Creation
Roll 3d6 (or choose): one for Descriptor, one for Bear Type / Skill, one for Role. Hats are optional (1d8).
DESCRIPTOR (1d6): 1 Rookie • 2 Washed‑Up • 3 Retired • 4 Unhinged • 5 Slick • 6 Incompetent
ROLE (1d6): 1 Muscle • 2 Brains • 3 Driver • 4 Hacker • 5 Thief • 6 Face

Scenario
HONEYCON 2025 isn’t a single ballroom this year - it’s a moving spectacle: a busy truck convoy called The Nectar Fleet, eighteen gleaming refrigerated rigs snaking down the interstate with pop‑up tasting lounges, influencer lounges, and VIP vault‑trailers.
Organizer: Greedy and Wicked - Mellifera Global, helmed (on this tour stop) by regional director Astra Kline, a smile as sweet as a cease‑and‑desist letter.
Venue Quality: Busy Truck Convoy - tonight’s overnight stop is the neon‑bright Buc‑ee’s mega travel center off the highway.
The Prize (aside from heaps of honey): a briefcase of pure Mānuka extract worth $5 million, scheduled for a midnight reveal and press photo.
Security (visible):
Armed guards in black polos with earpieces;
A thick CCTV network mounted on truck corners and drone perches.
Rumors in the parking lot:
Influencers have special wristbands to access VIP lounges.
The vault‑trailer is numbered #09, sandwiched between the tasting lounge and the merch truck.
A forklift was seen moving a glossy carbon‑fiber case an hour ago.
Clock: It’s 11:11 PM. Midnight is in 49 minutes. 
The night air hums with sodium lights and diesel idling. Buc‑ee’s neon beaver grins down as The Nectar Fleet hisses to a halt across three rows of truck slots. Polished trailers mirror each other in perfect lines, each stamped with a golden hexagon and the motto: “Purity. Provenance. Power.”

A pop‑up stage blares synthpop; honey cocktails sparkle in mason jars; influencers in black‑and‑yellow drip walk past a velvet rope toward VIP Trailer #09 - the rumored vault.

Security sweeps the perimeter: pairs of guards stroll predictable loops; drones blink red above the roofs; cameras pivot in lazy arcs. A laminated sign reads: “MIDNIGHT UNVEILING: PURE MĀNUKA EXTRACT  -  $5,000,000.”

You’ve cased the lot. You’ve got 49 minutes. Honey’s on the other side of those doors.

Where do we first see you, and what do you do?
Suggested entry vectors
Pick one or create your own
Social Engineering (CRIMINAL): Blend with VIPs/influencers, forge/steal a wristband, talk your way past the velvet rope.
Silent Route (CRIMINAL or BEAR‑Climb): Up the service ladder, across trailer roofs, dropping in from the catwalk to an access hatch.
Hot Wheels (Driver/Mechanics): Get a forklift, golf cart, or even a semi moving to rearrange trailers and make a corridor - or a distraction.
All-out Bear (BEAR): Intimidate, terrify, or cause calculated carnage to scatter security.
ACTION QUEUE

11:13 PM
Roofline over Trailer #09
Barbara leaps. Glossy aluminum sings under soft paws as the little glitter crown snags neon like a lure. She skims the convoy spine—#06, #07, #08—breath fogging in the cold from the reefers. Down below, mason jars clink and someone laughs too loud at a brand joke. She hits the rubber boot‑seam on #09 and sticks it. The metal is beaded with condensation; one corner bristles with a low camera turret that ticks in a lazy arc. A drone blinks red and keeps not‑looking up. Her tail anchors; her claws find the maintenance hatch by touch, that sweet circus muscle memory coming back before the thought does.

Inside the trailer, muffled voices. A soft keypad chirp. The prize hums in the air like it knows its name.
@Daim Barbara (Retired Bearcat • Thief): BEAR 2 (-1) | CRIMINAL 4 (+1)
Result: you made the climb clean (≤ BEAR 3)
Greed: smooth success > moved 1 from BEAR > CRIMINAL.
Correction: I misspoke earlier, success is less than or equal to your stat, not greater. You still succeeded.
You’re above #09 with a hand on the hatch. How do you proceed?
 
11:14 PM
Perimeter crowd by the velvet rope
Flashback: criminal scheming...
Grrrrreg’s trenchcoat silhouette billows in the wind. A Mellifera crew lead slips out to doomscroll, lanyard crooked, wristband glinting. The side door breathes conditioned air twenty feet away; a pair of polos drift through their loop, all momentum and no urgency. Pancakes from the flashback still haunt your tongue. The debt, too.

You angle in, catching the crew lead’s eye like you planned it hours ago—because you did.
@Tom - Grrrrreg (Retired Panda • Brains): BEAR 2 (-1) | CRIMINAL 4 (+1)
To blackmail somebody into letting you in through the side door, /roll 2d6, keep the lowest, aiming ≤ 4 (CRIMINAL with Brains).
Tell us the leverage you use as you press in close.
 
11:15 PM
VIP rope at Trailer #09
Sequins. Ring lights. A DJ who thinks silence is a rumor. Petunia wades into the influencer eddy with a mom‑smile that parts crowds like shopping carts on a Saturday. The purple crown rides high; the heels bite; the dress is riding up and this whole scene is about to get a pep talk if it doesn’t behave. The wristband scanner chirps in steady little bites as a host waves the chosen through.

You’re at the rope with the look of someone who belongs, who will stare you into believing it if you don’t.
@icey - Petunia (Washed‑Up Grizzly • Muscle): BEAR 3 | CRIMINAL 3
Blend and drift past the rope, then /roll 1d6 for CRIMINAL, aiming ≤ 3.
(If you switch gears and Terrify, say so to use your Bear special: roll 2d6 keep lowest vs BEAR.)
What’s the vibe or line you drop as the scanner beeps?
 
11:16 PM
Cab of the parked rig near #10
Flashback: plan to hijack a semi
Slick ghost‑slides into a parked semi like it still has his smell in the seat. Key turns. Engine purrs a bassline under the synthpop. He nudges the wheel with two clean licks of the paws—“Ten and two, baby. Ten and two.”—and inches forward casual. The merch truck throws a fat shadow; a camera’s line of sight clips the trailer edge… until your nose threads the rig just so. A drone widens its arc at the noise, then gets bored. A polo half‑glances, then doesn’t.

You can cut a blind corridor here—one clean alley where eyes don’t go. The trilby tilts like it knows.
@scottie - Slick (Honey Badger • Driver/Carnage): BEAR 2 | CRIMINAL 4
Ease the semi into the exact blind spot and /roll 2d6, keep the lowest, aiming ≤ 4 (CRIMINAL with Driver)
Describe the approach you take as you thread that steel needle.
 
At the same time...
Edge of the lot, by the ice freezer
The Beeves orbit Puddles like anxious punctuation. The canteen sloshes—comfort and countdown. The air is dry, the night is bright, and the convoy throws golden hexes across the asphalt. Somewhere dead‑center: #09 and five million in Mānuka, the kind of shine that makes a bear do brave, dumb, beautiful things.

Hydration first. Then miracles.
@Cyforg - Puddles (Unhinged Tardigrade • Thief): BEAR 3 | CRIMINAL 3
Ruling: Your Tardigrade Special skill is to Squeeze into or Survive deadly environments.
Declare your first move and roll vs the relevant stat. If Thief or Tardigrade applies, roll 2d6 keep the lowest. Success is ≤ your stat.
Describe how you stay hydrated as you accomplish this first action.
 
East Wall Utility Conduit (CCTV Junction)
The utility corner hums with cheap power and bad decisions. A junction box labeled MELLIFERA EYE — VLAN 12 buzzes inside a tangle of zip ties. Someone left an open drone case on a folding table with a spare battery blinking green. Buc‑ee’s guest Wi‑Fi pings your phone like a dare. No one’s watching this pocket… yet.

You in the beanie, paws in the wires, the whole night ready to rewrite itself if you type it fast enough.
@Disaster_of_Rad - acid_burn (Black Bear • Hacker): BEAR 3 | CRIMINAL 3
You can change your name, otherwise you'll be named acid_burn
Declare your first move at the junction and roll against the fitting stat. If you’re hacking, roll CRIMINAL with Hacker: /roll 2d6 keep lowest, aiming ≤ 3. If you go paws‑on hardware, call BEAR. What do you do?
