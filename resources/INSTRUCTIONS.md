# Overview of _Masks_

_Masks_ is a tabletop roleplaying game about young superheroes exploring identity, relationships, and heroism. Characters are part of a team trying to figure out who they are while juggling personal lives and saving Halcyon City. The system uses a collaborative conversation model (dialogue between players and GM), supported by lightweight mechanics to resolve uncertain outcomes and push story forward.

## Core Concepts and Structures

### 1. Conversation & Framing Scenes

*   **The game flows through conversation** among players and the GM. Everyone describes what their characters do, think, and feel.
    
*   **Scenes** are framed like comic book panels: a location, the characters present, and a situation that drives action. Scenes should start in medias res or move to where interesting decisions need to be made, often with the question, “What do you do?”
    
*   **Playing to Find Out**: Instead of planning outcomes, players discover the story by reacting to mechanics and the fiction. That uncertainty is part of the game’s fun.
    

### 2. Moves

Moves are structured triggers with associated outcomes. To trigger a move, characters must actually do what the move requires. If uncertain about what happens next, consult the move.

**Types of Moves:**

*   **Basic Moves**: Common actions available to all characters, such as directly engage a threat, unleash your powers, defend someone, assess the situation, provoke someone, comfort or support someone, and pierce someone’s mask.
    
*   **Playbook Moves**: Special moves unique to each playbook, highlighting a character’s niche.
    
*   **Team Moves**: Trigger when heroes share a triumphant celebration or a vulnerability/weakness.
    
*   **GM Moves**: The GM uses these to drive conflict when the narrative stalls, or when players roll a miss.
    
*   **Adult Moves**: Late in the campaign, characters can unlock mature, more potent moves (e.g., overwhelming a vulnerable foe, persuading someone with their best interests).
    

**Rolling Dice:**

*   Most moves instruct players to roll 2d6 and add a relevant Label or other modifiers.
    
*   **Results**:
    
    *   **10+ (Strong Hit)**: A full success, granting best results.
        
    *   **7-9 (Weak Hit)**: A partial success with complications or costs.
        
    *   **6- (Miss)**: The move fails or the GM makes a hard move against the character.
        

### 3. Labels

Labels measure how characters see themselves and how others perceive them. Each character has five Labels:

*   **Danger**: How threatening/powerful they feel.
    
*   **Freak**: How strange/unique they feel.
    
*   **Savior**: How protective/self-sacrificing they are.
    
*   **Superior**: How capable and clever they feel relative to others.
    
*   **Mundane**: How ordinary/human they feel.
    

**Label Shifts**:

*   Characters’ Labels change frequently—triggered by influence, moves, or in-character choices.
    
*   When a Label changes, another must shift in the opposite direction unless it’s locked (±3 or –2).
    
*   If a shift would push past the extremes, no shift happens and the player marks a condition instead.
    

### 4. Influence

*   **Influence** represents how much a character cares about someone else’s opinion.
    
*   Characters must track who holds Influence over them and over whom they have Influence.
    
*   **Gaining Influence** allows someone to shift the target’s Labels (following the fiction).
    
*   Influence can be used or given up to push narrative changes (e.g., take an extra +1, inflict a condition).
    

### 5. Conditions

When things go wrong, characters mark conditions—negative emotional states that hinder performance:

*   **Afraid**: –2 to directly engage a threat
    
*   **Angry**: –2 to comfort/support or pierce the mask
    
*   **Guilty**: –2 to provoke or assess
    
*   **Hopeless**: –2 to unleash powers
    
*   **Insecure**: –2 to defend or reject others’ Influence
    

Characters clear conditions through specific actions (e.g., venting anger, acting to absolve guilt, or through specific moves).

### 6. Team & Team Pool

*   **Team Pool** is a collective resource used to enhance rolls or aid teammates in combat.
    
*   Team points are gained at the start of battle (and via moves) and spent to give +1 to a teammate’s roll or to act selfishly to raise your own Label temporarily.
    
*   Scenes start with 1 team by default or more if entering battle with a dangerous foe as a team.
    

### 7. Moment of Truth

Each playbook has a “Moment of Truth” (unlocked via advancement). In this dramatic scene, players get full narrative control to show off why their character embodies their archetype and to change the story fundamentally. After, one Label locks permanently, reflecting the character’s epiphany.

### 8. Advancement & Growth

Characters mark potential on misses. After five misses, they earn an “advancement” (new move, Label shift, or unlocking their Moment of Truth). After five core advancements, characters can take adult moves, switch playbooks, or retire.

## Playbooks (Character Archetypes)


Each playbook provides:

*   A narrative archetype,
    
*   A set of abilities/powers,
    
*   Unique moves, extras, and backstory questions,
    
*   A specific relationship prompt (“When our team first came together...”),
    
*   Influence assignment rules.
